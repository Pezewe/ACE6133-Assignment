What is the main difference between FIR and IIR filters in terms of system response?
FIR filters have a finite impulse response, while IIR filters have an infinite impulse response due to feedback.

Why are FIR filters generally preferred for linear phase applications?
FIR filters can be designed to have exact linear phase, preserving the waveform shape of signals within the passband.

What is the minimum sampling frequency of a 10kHz signal?
20kHz
1
The minimum sampling frequency of a 90Hz signal
180Hz
3
Name one advantage of IIR filters over FIR filters.
IIR filters can achieve a desired frequency response using fewer coefficients, making them more computationally efficient.
